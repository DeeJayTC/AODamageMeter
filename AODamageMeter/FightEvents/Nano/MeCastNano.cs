        // [Me Cast Nano] Nano program executed successfully.

        // This will happen if you spam the button:
        // [Me Cast Nano] Executing Nano Program: Improved Healing.
        // [Me Cast Nano] Wait for current nano program execution to finish.
        // [Me Cast Nano] Unable to execute nano program. You can't execute this nano on the target.
        // [Me Cast Nano] Nano program executed successfully.

        // This will happen if you spam multiple buttons, sometimes:
        // [Me Cast Nano] Executing Nano Program: Lifegiving Elixir.
        // [Me Cast Nano] Executing Nano Program: Improved Healing.
        // [Me got health] You were healed for 668 points.
        // [Me Cast Nano] Nano program executed successfully.
        // [Me Cast Nano] Wait for current nano program execution to finish.

        // In the last case, LE is what succeeded, IH was never actually executing. I consider it a bug in AO's
        // logs that IH was shown there at all. But it means we could interpret the 'wait' as an end event of IH.
        // Waits aren't always end events though, as the middle case shows. There, the wait isn't associated with
        // any start event. The most important metric to get right is how many actual casts there were (no weird
        // fake casts like in the last case), and if they ended in a success, resist, counter, or abort. To achieve
        // that, we remember the latest potential start event, and mark it with one of the 4 real cast results
        // when the end event comes in. The details can get muddled when the last case happens. There, we'll log
        // it as IH succeeding, when in reality it was LE succeeding. But scenario is rare and the %s remain true.
