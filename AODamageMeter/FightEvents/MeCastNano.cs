    // Here are some different cases to consider:

    // This is the basic case:
    // [Me Cast Nano] Executing Nano Program: Improved Healing.
    // [Me Cast Nano] Nano program executed successfully.

    // This will happen if you spam the button:
    // [Me Cast Nano] Executing Nano Program: Improved Healing.
    // [Me Cast Nano] Wait for current nano program execution to finish.
    // [Me Cast Nano] Unable to execute nano program. You can't execute this nano on the target.
    // [Me Cast Nano] Nano program executed successfully.

    // This will happen if you spam multiple buttons, sometimes:
    // [Me Cast Nano] Executing Nano Program: Lifegiving Elixir.
    // [Me Cast Nano] Executing Nano Program: Improved Healing.
    // [Me got health] You were healed for 668 points.
    // [Me Cast Nano] Nano program executed successfully.
    // [Me Cast Nano] Wait for current nano program execution to finish.

    // In the last case, LE is what succeeded, IH was never actually executing. I consider it a bug in AO's
    // logs that IH was shown there at all. But it means we could interpret the 'wait' as an end event of IH.
    // Waits aren't always end events though, as the middle case shows. There, the wait isn't associated with
    // any start event. The most important metric to get right is how many actual casts there were (no weird
    // fake casts like in the last case), and if they ended in a success, resist, counter, or abort. To achieve
    // that, we remember the latest potential start event, and mark it with one of the 4 real cast results
    // when the end event comes in. The details can get muddled when the last case happens. There, we'll log
    // it as IH succeeding, when in reality it was LE succeeding. But scenario is rare and the %s remain true.

    // Here's another one I recently found. Freak Shield is a perk, but creates a Me Cast Nano success...
    // [System] You successfully perform Freak Shield.
    // [Me Cast Nano] Nano program executed successfully.
