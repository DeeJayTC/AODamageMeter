        /* The three pet events aren't super useful. "Your pet hit by monster" almost never happens, everything you'd expect
           in there actually happens in "Your pet hit by other". "Your pet hit by nano" also doesn't happen much. Neither of
           these can really be relied on to deduce pet names, because they happen so infrequently or would never happen in
           common DD-testing areas like the duel room. So that leaves "Your pet hit by other", which actually includes your
           pet hit by other and other hit by your pet. But it doesn't include your pet's shields/reflects doing damage--those
           get included in "Other hit by other". We could try to do better, but for now we're just gonna go with supporting a
           convention. We don't pay special attention to the pet events, but just apply this reasoning across all events:

           If we see a source/target with exactly the same name as the owner, it gets attributed to a pet character named
           "<Owner>'s pets". This works because the owner's name never appears in the log for their own events--there's
           just the contextual "You". If we see a source/target with a name prefixed by {an existent character's name and
           an apostrophe}, it gets registered as a pet character. In both cases, the corresponding character has the pet
           character added to their pets. For example, we support an aggregate pet breakdown if the owner is "Elitengi"
           and he names his pets "Elitengi", and an individual pet breakdown if the PC is "Elitengi" and he names his
           pets "Elitengi's Robo" and "Elitengi's Doggo". The aggregate pet breakdown only works for the owner. For
           non-owner characters, all we can do is add the damage to the character. The individual pet breakdown works for
           all characters, owner and non-owner alike. We don't really expect any false positives here because the apostrophe
           is an uncommonly used character across NPC and pet names right now. Biggest false positive is when a PC names
           their pet the same as some other PC, and we can't do anything about that. We don't bother checking if the pet
           owner is a PC, because that would complicate debugging/testing static log files, when the knowledge of a character
           being a PC comes in eventually from people.anarchy-online.com, well after all the parsing has happened. */
